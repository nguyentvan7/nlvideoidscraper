# Northernlion Video ID Scraper
Simple script to scrape all of NL's uploaded videos. If you rerun it, it will only scrape what it hasn't already saved.

Also will push to a git repo for you (requires git to be installed).

Use `python-dotenv` to set up your own YouTube API key and optional git repo. As of 01/22/22, this uses about 314 quota points.
